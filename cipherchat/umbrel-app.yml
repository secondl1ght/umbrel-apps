  Cipherchat is a private messaging web application powered by bitcoin's lightning network and can be self-hosted.

  Users connect their lightning node to Cipherchat by using Lightning Node Connect (LNC) and entering a pairing phrase obtained through Lightning Terminal. This creates an end-to-end encrypted connection between your node running anywhere in the world and the web app. The entire tech stack is open-source. Once connected, users use keysend payments attached with messages to communicate with eachother.

  Get started using private and secure messaging on the worlds most powerful decentralized network!
